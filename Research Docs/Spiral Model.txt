Spiral model

In 1988 Boehm developed the spiral model as an iterative model which includes risk analysis and risk management.
Extends waterfall model by adding iteration to explore/manage risk

Project risk is a moving target. Natural to progress a project cyclically in four step phases
-Consider alternative scenarios, constraints
-Identify and resolve risks
-Execute the phase
-Plan next phase: e.g. user req, software req, architecture and repeat from start again


Strengths-
	Realism: the model accurately reflects the iterative nature of software development on projects with unclear requirements
	Flexible: incorporates the advantages of the waterfall and evolutionary methods
	Reduces risk factors within the development process. 
	Excellent process visibility with documentation produced at each quadrant and phase.
	
Weaknesses-
	Needs technical expertise in risk analysis and risk management to work well.
	Model is poorly understood by non-technical management, hence not so widely used
	Complicated model, needs competent professional management. High administrative overhead.
	Too involved for small scale projects.

Types of projects and environments it suits-
	Too involved for small scale projects.
