Incremental Model

The incremental build model is a method of software development where the model is designed, 
implemented and tested incrementally (a little more is added each time) until the product is finished.
Each module passes through the requirements, design, implementation and testing phases.

Strengths-
	Generates working software quickly and early during the software life cycle
	More flexible â€“ less costly to change scope and requirements.
	Each iteration is an easily managed milestone.
	
Weaknesses-
	Total cost is higher than waterfall
	Falls apart without solid planning and design
	
	
Types of projects and environments it suits-
	A project where there is a need to get a product to the market early
	Where a new technology is being used
	
Critical Factors-
	Major requirements must be defined; however, some details can evolve with time.
	This model can be used when the requirements of the complete system are clearly defined and understood.
